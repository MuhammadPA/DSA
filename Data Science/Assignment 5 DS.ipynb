    "    Target leakage refers to situations where information that would not be available at the time of prediction is included in the feature set. This can lead to unrealistically high model performance during training and evaluation. Train-test contamination, on the other hand, occurs when the training data is contaminated with information from the test or validation set, causing the model to implicitly learn patterns specific to the test set and artificially inflate performance metrics."

    "\n",
    "   - Thorough understanding of the data: Gain a deep understanding of the data generation process and the relationships between the features and the target variable. Identify potential sources of leakage and carefully design the feature engineering and preprocessing steps to prevent accidental leakage.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Proper data splitting: Ensure that the data is split into training, validation, and test sets before any preprocessing or feature engineering steps. This prevents information from the test set from leaking into the training process.\n",

    "   - Feature engineering: Be cautious not to include features that leak information from the target variable or are derived from future information that would not be available during prediction. Feature engineering should be based on information that is available at the time of prediction.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Cross-validation: Utilize proper cross-validation techniques, such as stratified k-fold or time series cross-validation, to evaluate model performance. This helps in detecting any potential leakage by ensuring that the model's performance is assessed on unseen data.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - Domain expertise and review: Engage domain experts or subject matter experts to review the data and model pipeline to identify any potential sources of leakage. Their insights and knowledge can be valuable in identifying and mitigating leakage risks."
