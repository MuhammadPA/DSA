Squared loss penalizes larger errors more than absolute loss because it squares the difference between predicted and actual values. This makes squared loss more sensitive to outliers, as the squared error can increase rapidly. In contrast, absolute loss treats all errors equally, providing a more robust measure of error that is not as affected by outliers."
